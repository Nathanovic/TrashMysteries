  Texts:
  - Hey there!
  - Hello mister mole.
  - Can you help me please?
  - Of course! How can I help?
  - Well, I haven't seen my brother in days! Last time I saw him he was digging holes
    beneath some boulders over there.
  - I'll see what I can do. Do you have any idea why he was caving over there?
  - He said he was digging for treasures, seemed quite obsessed to me.
  - Thanks, I'll see if I can find him!
